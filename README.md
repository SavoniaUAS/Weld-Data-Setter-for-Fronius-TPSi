This software can be used to send identifying part information and part serial number to welding machine so that components traceability is possible to full fill. Works with at least Fronius TPSi welding machines for collecting welding parameters to Fronius WeldCube Premium welding data manager. Allows one to set welding machines IP address and port number (4714 as default) where entered information is about to be sent. Works as is in small scale production and in research purposes.
